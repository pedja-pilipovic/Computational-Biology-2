# Computational Biology 2

Second part of the course [Computational Biology](https://clovisg.github.io/teaching/protein-structure-prediction/session1.html) at Master of Science in Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 

Requirements: 

* Work Package (WP) 1:
  * T1 - one tool that takes two simple FASTA sequencing files (reads) and outputs a list of SNPs,

  * T2 - one tool that takes a multiple sequence alignment in standard FASTA file format and outputs a protein structure.

* WP2:
  * T3 - make a Proof of concept (POC) of the tools of WP1 on the current Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis by understanding what is the difference between the strains, what gene(s) is involved, build a model of the protein structure associated to the gene and give a possible explanation.
